  My Story
</h2>

<br>

  <h4> Sophicopy is a digital business brand that was founded by Sophia Oladapo in the month of September, 2021.
    <br> <br>
    The idea of Sophicopy came when Sophia was just a teenager, her father's business was what funded her family as her mother had no job, so when her father's business stopped having great sales as it used to, things got bad and her family's finances went down totally and she and her elder siblings had to drop out of school. <br> <br>
    Now out of that terrible situation, she wanted to put a stop to the problem of "no sales" and with that Sophicopy was born.
