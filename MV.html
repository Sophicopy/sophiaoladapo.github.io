      <h2>
          Have you ever entered YouTube or any social media platform and saw an ad with awesome graphics or a video ad that you just couldn't take your eyes off?
         Well, you're not alone in this, about 122,000,000 people just like you have their eyes stuck to these ads everyday on YouTube.
         
          <br >
         But thinking about it, won't it be nice to have that much of people viewing your ads daily? <br>
         If so much of people get to know about your business, your site will be flooded with potential customers.

          <p>
              But you might say "I don't know how to create professional videos nor do I have that much knowledge in graphics".  
             You don't have to worry about that, there are plenty video makers that are easy to use, all you have to do is pick your scenes, make sure it matches with the aim of the video and keep it's short and precise.
           </p>
         
          <p>
               But I have a bad news, due to the increase in pop up ads and all sorts of video ads, hatred and resistence towards ads has grown so much that now it is easier for a potential client to forget your ad without thinking twice about it. And also it takes time and energy with professional skills to create a video ad that actually converts.
          </p>
          
          <p>
